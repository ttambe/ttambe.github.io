I am an incoming Assistant Professor in the [Department of Electrical Engineering](https://ee.stanford.edu/) at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/), starting in Autumn 2024.
My research is building a heterogeneity of solutions co-optimized across the algorithm, memory subsystem, hardware architecture, and silicon stack to generate breakthrough advances in arithmetic performance, compute density and flexibility, and energy efficiency for on-chip machine learning, and emerging compute-intensive applications. I also bear a keen interest in agile system-on-chip (SoC) design methodologies. 
My work received Best Paper Award at DAC (2020), ACM SIGDA Research Highlights (2021), IEEE MICRO Top Picks Honorable Mention (2022) accolades, and has been recognized with a [NVIDIA Graduate Fellowship](https://research.nvidia.com/graduate-fellowships/2021) (2021), and an [IEEE SSCS Predoctoral Achievement Award](https://sscs.ieee.org/membership/young-professionals/sscs-predoctoral-achievement-award) (2021).
I received my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering at Harvard University. Prior to debuting my doctoral studies, I was a senior engineer at Intel, where I designed various mixed-signal transceiver and peripheral circuits for [EMIB](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/corporate/usa-chipmaking/news-and-resources/video-intel-emib-technology-explained.html)-based chips.
