I am an Assistant Professor of Electrical Engineering and, by courtesy, of Computer Science at Stanford University. My research explores the intersection of AI/ML and hardware systems. Specifically, my research group develops algorithms, hardware architectures, chips, and tools to make accelerated AI computing more portable, scalable, efficient, and easier to design. Previously, I was a visiting research scientist at NVIDIA and an engineer at Intel. I received a B.S., and M.Eng. from Texas A&M University, and a Ph.D. from Harvard University, all in Electrical Engineering.
